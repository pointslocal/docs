> The navigation elements in the admin consist of six main elements that allow you to easily find and begin working on content and settings as needed. 

All content types are accessible directly by clicking on:
* Stories
* Events
* Packages
* Venues

On the left side of the nav is a “hamburger” icon that when clicked exposes links to a number of non-content management functions including:

**View Homepage** - takes you directly to the homepage of the events site

**Neighborhoods** - where neighborhoods are configured, edited, added or deleted

**Event Categories** - where categories are configured, edited, added or deleted

**Imports** - where you can review imports, their current status and request new imports

**Template Elements** - where custom design elements of the site, CSS and JS can be setup and managed

**Users** - where admin users are created and login/profile information can be managed

**Revenue** - where self-serve upgrade revenue can be tracked

**Analytics** - a direct link to the suite of reports that include number of events, event impressions, featured events and more


On the right side of the nav bar is an icon with three vertically stacked dots. This icon exposes links to logout or to directly access your user profile to make edits.
