# Featuring Events

> Featuring events is a way to highlight commercially-upsold events.  This can be done from the user's side if self-serve upgrades are available.  It can also be accomplished by admins via the web admin interface.

## Featuring an Event

> Follow these steps to feature or unfeature one or multiple days for an event.

1. **Log into admin**.  Make sure you are logged into your admin interface.  Note that these directions pertain exclusively to our version 2 admin.

2. **Click `Events` Tab**. This will bring you to the general events presentation and search interface.

3. **Locate and Open Event**.  Once you've searched for or located your event, click anywhere on the card to open the `Edit Event` interface.

4. **Toggle Today's Featured Status**.  If you only need to feature the event for today, click the toggle labeled `Featured` to toggle today's status on or off.  If you're done, click `Save Event`.

5. **Select Multiple Days**.  If you need to schedule days, click the `Schedule` link below the featured toggle.  You'll be presented with 1-year calendar.  Clicking a single date will toggle its featured status for that day.  Double-clicking a date will start a date range that can be closed by double-clicking the end date.  This allows you to schedule an event for 3 days, 2 weeks or more without individually clicking each. When done, click `Save`

## Caveats

> Featured events will only show if there are one or more future recurrences. For example, if an event runs from January 1 to January 8 and you feature for the 9th, it will not show unless there is an additional recurrence for that day.
